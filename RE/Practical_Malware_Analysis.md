# Practical Malware Analysis - 1st Ed.

## Chapter 0 - Malware Analysis Primer

### Goals of Malware Analysis

- Inspect behavior, contain damage & develop signatures
  - Host-based signatures - monitors files and registry changes
  - Network signatures - monitors network traffic
  
### Malware Analysis Techniques

- Basic Static Analysis - examining the contents without running it
  - Quick and easy, but often misses important details
- Basic Dynamic Analysis - running the executable and observing it's behaviour
  - Risky without proper setup, but can reveal more details
- Advanced Static Analysis - dissassembling the executable, looking at constructs/calls
  - Steeper learning curve, but reveals a lot more about what is going on
- Advanced Dynamic Analysis - running the executable and observing systems state during execution
  - Most useful to gather difficult information, but most challenging techniques

### Types of Malware

- **Backdoor** - allows for attacker access
- **Botnet** - similar to backdoor, but all infected machines get same instruction
- **Downloader** - downloads other malicious code, often run right after backdoor achieved
- **Information-stealing malware** - collects information then sends to attacker
- **Launcher** - launches other malicious programs, usually to be stealthy
- **Rootkit** - hides existence of other code, usually paired with other programs
- **Scareware** - frightens victim into buying something, usually by emulating a anti-virus system
- **Spam-sending malware** - uses victim machine to send spam
- **Worm/Virus** - copies itself to infect additional machines
- Often malware can fall into different categories
- Typically better to focus on whether the attack is targeted or mass
  - Mass is more common, just looking for generic machines that are vulnerable
    - Easier to detect & remove, usually going after low hanging fruit
  - Targeted is less common, tailored for a specific organization or system
    - Much harder to find & remove, being less likely addressed by COTS solutions

### General Rules for Malware Analysis

- Don't get caught up on details! These things are big/complex, just focus on key features
- Different tools for different jobs. If you are stuck, try a different tool or approach
- Malware analysis is a cat & mouse game. Things are always changing, so try and keep up!
