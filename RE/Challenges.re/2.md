# Exercise #2

## Problem

What does this code do?

```
<f>:
   0:          mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x4]
   4:          bswap  eax
   6:          mov    edx,eax
   8:          and    eax,0xf0f0f0f
   d:          and    edx,0xf0f0f0f0
  13:          shr    edx,0x4
  16:          shl    eax,0x4
  19:          or     eax,edx
  1b:          mov    edx,eax
  1d:          and    eax,0x33333333
  22:          and    edx,0xcccccccc
  28:          shr    edx,0x2
  2b:          shl    eax,0x2
  2e:          or     eax,edx
  30:          mov    edx,eax
  32:          and    eax,0x55555555
  37:          and    edx,0xaaaaaaaa
  3d:          add    eax,eax
  3f:          shr    edx,1
  41:          or     eax,edx
  43:          ret
```

## Arguments

- esp + 4 - The dw to be inverted

## Behavior

Load eax with first stack item (likely first argument), then reverse eax byte order.
edx set to eax, then eax has upper halfs of bytes zeroed, edx has lower halfs zeroed.
shift edx right half a byte, shift eax left half a byte (edx left byte is 0, eax left byte is 0)
Or both registers, so only middle bytes have value. Value is the **or** of the middle bytes (both bytes now identical)
edx is reset to be eax again, then eax has all bits 2-7 cleared, edx has bits 1-2 cleared


## Analysis

This takes an argument passed on the stack then returns it via eax inverted at the bit level, by inverting the bytes,
then the nibbles, half nibbles then remaining bits.
