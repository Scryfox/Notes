# Exercise #1

## Problem

What does this code do? The function has 4 arguments and it is compiled by GCC for Linux x64 ABI (i.e., arguments are passed in registers).

```
<f>:
   0:                   mov    r8,rdi
   3:                   push   rbx
   4:                   mov    rdi,rsi
   7:                   mov    rbx,rdx
   a:                   mov    rsi,r8
   d:                   xor    rdx,rdx

begin:
  10:                   lods   rax,QWORD PTR ds:[rsi]
  12:                   div    rbx
  15:                   stos   QWORD PTR es:[rdi],rax
  17:                   loop   begin
  19:                   pop    rbx
  1a:                   mov    rax,rdx
  1d:                   ret
```

## Arguments

- rcx - length of array
- rdi - pointer to start of array to process
- rsi - pointer to start of array to store elements
- rdx - the number to divide each element by

## Behavior

- Divides each element in the rsi array by rdx, then stores it into the rdi array

- Returns rdx (0)

## Analysis

Function takes an array, a place to store it, the number of elements in the array and a number
to divide each array element by then divides each element by the given number, returning zero
if the operation was a success (void function return type likely)
