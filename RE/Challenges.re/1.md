# Exercise #1

## Arguements

- rcx - length of array
- rdi - pointer to start of array to process
- rsi - pointer to start of array to store elements
- rdx - the number to divide each element by

## Behavior

- Divides each element in the rsi array by rdx, then stores it into the rdi array

- Returns rdx (0)

## Analysis

Function takes an array, a place to store it, the number of elements in the array and a number
to divide each array element by then divides each element by the given number, returning zero
if the operation was a success (void function return type likely)
